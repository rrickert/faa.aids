19930422011989I	FLIGHT ATTENDANT HIT HEAD ON CEILING DURING TURBULENCE WHILE DESCENDING. (.19) ON APRIL 22, 1993, AT ABOUT 1420 EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME A SHORT BROTHERS SD 3-60, N159CC, ENCOUNTERED SEVERE TURBULENCE DURING CRUISE FLIGHT ABOUT 30 NMI WEST OF CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA. FLIGHT 5052 WAS OPERATED BY CCAIR, INC., DOING BUSINESS AS (DBA) USAIR EXPRESS, UNDER 14 CFR PART 121, AS A SCHEDULED, DOMESTIC, PASSENGER FLIGHT. AN INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR) FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED AND ACTIVATED. VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS PREVAILED. THERE WERE MINOR INJURIES TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, AND NO INJURIES TO THE 33 PASSENGERS, NOR THE TWO FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS. THE AIRPLANE WAS NOT DAMAGED. ORIGINATION OF THE FLIGHT WAS THE TRI-CITY REGIONAL AIRPORT (TRI), AT BRISTOL/JOHNSON CITY/KINGSPORT, TENNESSEE, AT 1345 ON THE SAME DAY. CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA WAS THE DESTINATION.  THE AIRPLANE HAD BEEN FLOWN FROM CHARLOTTE TO TRI AS FLIGHT 5006. IT ARRIVED AT TRI AT 1320, AND WAS AT THE GATE AT 1325. FLIGHT 5052 LEFT THE GATE ENROUTE TO CHARLOTTE AT 1345 AND DEPARTED TRI AT 1350. ACCORDING TO THE FLIGHT CREW, A HIGHER ALTITUDE WAS REQUESTED, TO AVOID THE BUMPY FLIGHT CONDITIONS THAT WERE EXPERIENCED DURING T HE FLIGHT TO BRISTOL, VIRGINIA. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) ASSIGNED 10,000 FEET, WHICH AFFORDED SMOOTH FLIGHT CONDITIONS. LATER, THE FLIGHT WAS ASSIGNED 9,000 FEET. SHORTLY AFTER BEGINNING THE DESCENT, THE AIRPLANE ENCOUNTERED A SHARP JOLT OF SEVERE TURBULENCE. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT REPORTED THAT SHE WAS IN THE GALLEY AT THE TIME OF THE SEVERE JOLT OF TURBULENCE. SHE STRUCK THE CEILING OF THE AIRPLANE AND FELL BACK TO THE FLOOR. AS SHE TRIED TO RISE, SHE WAS UNSTEADY AND FELL AGAIN, INTO THE EMERGENCY DOOR. SHE CALLED FOR HELP, AND A PASSENGER CAME TO HER ASSISTANCE. THE PASSENGER KNOCKED ON THE COCKPIT DOOR TO NOTIFY THE FLIGHT CREW OF THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S INJURIES. THE FLIGHT CONTINUED TO CHARLOTTE WHERE THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT RECEIVED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT STATED THAT, DURING THE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEFING PRIOR TO DEPARTING CHARLOTTE, SHE HAD REQUESTED SPECIFIC NOTICE FROM THE FLIGHT CREW WHEN IT WAS SAFE TO BEGIN CABIN SERVICE. THE REQUEST WAS MADE BECAUSE OF THE TURBULENCE SHE HAD NOTED DURING HER COMMUTE TO WORK THAT MORNING. ONCE ON THE GROUND AT THE TRI THE REQUEST WAS REPEATED. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT STATED THAT, DURING THE PRE-FLIGHT BRIEFING PRIOR TO DEPARTING  CHARLOTTE, SHE HAD REQUESTED SPECIFIC NOTICE FROM THE FLIGHT CREW WHEN IT WAS SAFE TO BEGIN CABIN SERVICE. THE REQUEST WAS MADE BECAUSE OF THE TURBULENCE SHE HAD NOTED DURING HER COMMUTE TO WORK THAT MORNING. ONCE ON THE GROUND AT THE TRI THE REQUEST WAS REPEATED. AFTER LEAVING TRI, THE FLIGHT CREW CHIMED THE CABIN TO NOTIFY THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT THAT CABIN SERVICE COULD BEGIN. ACCORDING TO THE FLIGHT CREW, A CHIME WAS THE PRE-ARRANGED SIGNAL THAT CABIN SERVICE COULD COMMENCE. THE FLIGHT CREW STATED THAT WHEN ATC CLEARED THE FLIGHT TO DESCEND, THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WAS NOTIFIED OF THE DESCENT VIA THE CABIN INTERPHONE AND ADVISED TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTED TURBULENCE. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT REPORTED ABOUT ONE-HALF OF THE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN SERVED BEVERAGES, AND THAT SHE HAD RETURNED TO THE GALLEY FOR ADDITIONAL BEVERAGES. WHILE IN THE GALLEY, THE FLIGHT EXPERIENCED "PRETTY ROUGH STUFF REAL QUICK," AND SHE FELL AGAINST THE WALL. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO SET DOWN THE BEVERAGE TRAY, THE FLIGHT CREW CHIMED HER. AS SHE WAS ATTEMPTING TO REPLACE THE PHONE, THE SEVERE TURBULENCE OCCURRED. DURING THE FLIGHT CREW INTERVIEW, THE CAPTAIN STATED THAT THE AREA FORECAST IS ALWAYS PROVIDED BY THE FLIGHT DISPATCHER. SHE DID NOT RECALL ITS CONTENTS. SHE INDICATED THAT SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE DIRECTION AND VELOCITY OF FORECAST WINDS ALOFT, NOR THE WINDS AT ALTITUDE DURING THE FLIGHT. IT WAS HER PERCEPTION, AND THE FIRST OFFICER'S PERCEPTION, THAT THEIR FLIGHT WAS THE FIRST TO ENCOUNTER THE SEVERE TURBULENCE. THE CAPTAIN STATED THAT SHE DID NOT MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL WEATHER INFORMATION REQUE

19940715034609I	NARRATIVE: THE PILOT STATED THAT, WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO, HE FELT A SLIGHT YAW IN THE AIRCRAFT AND HEARD A THUMP. THE PILOT DIVERTED THE AIRCRAFT TO AN OFFSHORE PLATFORM LOCATED APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES FROM THE POINT OF THE INCIDENT AND MADE A NORMAL LANDING. SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE PLATFORM REVEALED THAT THE LEFT LOWER BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT DOOR HAD SEPARATED FROM THE AIRCRAFT. THE OPERATOR REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT. THE BAGGAGE DOOR WAS LOST OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND WAS NOT RECOVERED. THE OPERATOR ROUTINELY ALLOWS PASSENGERS WHO DEPART AND BOARD THE AIRCRAFT TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT DOORS WHILE THE PILOT IS AT THE CONTROLS WITH THE AIRCRAFT RUNNING. THIS PROCEDURE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INSTALLATION WARNING LIGHTS IN THE COCKPIT WARNING THE PILOT WHEN A DOOR IS NOT SECURED; HOWEVER, THE BAGGAGE DOOR WARNING LIGHT ON THIS AIRCRAFT WAS DAMAGED AND NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THE OPERATOR SUSPECTS THAT THE BAGGAGE DOOR WAS NOT COMPLETELY SECURED BY THE PASSENGERS AT THE LAST DEPARTURE POINT. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PARTICULAR BAGGAGE DOOR, THE OPERATOR HAS IMPLEMENTED A PROCEDURE TO RESTRICT THE USE OF THIS BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT ONLY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE PILOT. THE OPERATOR HAS ALSO DISCOVERED A PROBLEM WITH MALFUNCTIONING DOOR WARNING LIGHTS THROUGHOUT ITS FLEET AND IS ADDRESSING THAT PROBLEM IN THE INSPECTION PROGRAMS FOR EACH AIRCRAFT.
